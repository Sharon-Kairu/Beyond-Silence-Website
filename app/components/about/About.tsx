              Founded in July 2025, Beyond Silence is a community dedicated to
              mental wellness and support. We provide a safe space for
              individuals to share their thoughts and experiences openly. Our

              we foster personal growth and healing. We believe every voice
              matters and every story deserves to be heard without judgment. Our
              team of volunteers and experts work together to create a nurturing
              environment. Join us in building a community where understanding,
              support, and hope thrive.
